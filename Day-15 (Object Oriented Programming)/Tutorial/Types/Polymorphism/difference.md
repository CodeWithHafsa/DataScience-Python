## Difference between Method Overloading and Method Overriding in Python: 

|S.No.| Method Overloading|	Method Overriding|
|------|------------------|-------------------|
|1.|In the method overloading, methods or functions must have the same name and different parameters.|Whereas in the method overriding, methods or functions must have the same name and same parameters.|
|2.|It is a type of Compile-time Polymorphism|It is a type of Run-time Polymorphism|
|3.|**It occurs in the same class** i.e. "Method overloading is performed between methods within the class."|**It occurs in two classes via inheritance** i.e. "Method overriding is done between parent class and child class methods."|
|4.|Methods must have the same name and different parameters|Methods must have the same name and same parameters|
|5.|Python does not support method overloading|Python supports method overriding|
|6.|In the method overloading, inheritance may or may not be required.|Whereas in method overriding, inheritance always required.|
