# What is Programming?
* It is a fastest way to tell computer what to do. (e.g. Calculator)

## Programming Languages: 
Python, C, C++, Java, Ruby etc.

# Python:
It is:
*  An interpreted language.
* Dynamically typed.
* A case-sensitive language. 
* Supports object-oriented Programming language.
* Gouido Vann Rossum started working on it in 1989.

``` python
print("Hello World", 7)
print(5)
```

# Features of python:
* Simple and easy programming language.
* Platform independent (means can work on any platform)
* An open-source language.
* Has big-library support. Some popular libraries are: NumPy, Tenserflow, OpenCv etc.

# Use of Python:
It can be used in: 
* Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
* Helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data insights and trends.
* AI and Machine Learning to learn from past data without hardcoding.
* Web applications
* Handle databases
* To perform complex mathematical analysis with data in buisness and accounting

### Interprator, Compiler, Transpilor
1. Interprator - a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code (i.e. 0101 language)
2. Compiler - translates Python code written in high-level human-readable form into low-level machine code or bytecode that can be executed directly by a computer.
3. Transpiler - a program that can process code in a certain language and generate the corresponding code in another language.

### Why Interprator is slow while compiler is fast?
Because interpartor execute code line by line, While compiler execute whole code once. 
On the other hand, Tranpilor execute only if all the lines are correct. Otherwise, it doesnot execute. 

### Some Extra Points:
* Zen of Python - It is like a poem of python.
* Head of Data Science Deep Learning World - Andrew N.G. (develop prompt engineering course)
* llama V2 - Opensource community of facebook (i.e. alternative of ChapGPT)
* Annaconda - Open source for Python
* With the help of different community packages, a strong community build.
* With the help of python interface we connect with: IOT, Metaverse, Cloud Computing, Blockchain, DataScience.
